The Real-Time Multi-Agent Simulation Platform (RT-MASP) is a sophisticated C++/Qt system designed to model and analyze large-scale interactions among autonomous agents, such as drones, vehicles, or virtual characters, in real-time. Its multi-threaded engine efficiently updates agent states, while the Qt-based interface provides interactive monitoring and control of dynamic environments. By integrating machine learning libraries (e.g., TensorFlow), agents can learn and adapt during simulations, enabling advanced research in areas like swarm robotics, traffic optimization, and strategic behavior. With modular environment classes, scalable architecture, and comprehensive data logging, RT-MASP delivers a powerful toolset for researchers and developers to prototype, refine, and evaluate complex multi-agent strategies before real-world deployment.
